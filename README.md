# Hexagon-Blend-Rule
A tool I made to use in another project. The idea behind this tool is I have a grid of hexagon tiles at various discrete height levels and their needs to be tiles that "bridge" those height plateaus, so this tool is used to make conditional rules to decide how and if the tile will blend plateaus. The main problem with writing automatic rules and hard coding a system to decide is their are so many permutations that you can be surprised by scenerios easily and want to change the rules. Another problem is you might want to add more conditions, this needs to be added into the code by hand but it isn't too much work to add more options. The idea is I want to be able to change the blending rules of the hexagon grid as I am working on it and seeing new scenerios crop up. So with this tool I can add very specific or broad rules as I feel the need to.
